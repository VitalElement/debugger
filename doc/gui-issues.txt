This is a list of GUI issues which need to be fixed for the next release.

* The debugger is now using Mini, so we should have a GUI element which lets you specify
  the JIT optimizations.

* The ProgramToDebug dialog needs some loving; for instance, there is no way to specify
  environment variables.

* "Insert breakpoint" from the context menu computes the wrong coordinates and thus
  inserts the breakpoint somewhere, but not where the user actually klicked.
  This is bug #40869.

* There seems to be a reference-counting bug somewhere in gtk#: if you display the "About"
  dialog several times, you get a crash.  I did some debugging, but I was unable to find it.
  This is now known as bug #41091.

Other issues:

* The GUI crashes or hangs somewhere after the application has quit.  I did a lot of debugging,
  but I was unable to find the problem yet.  Unfortunately, this bug cannot be reproduced after
  inserting some Console.WriteLine()s, so maybe this is some kind of a race condition.
  [Small update: I think I found the problem; at least, mini is giving me a useful backtrace.]
