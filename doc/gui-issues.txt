This is a list of GUI issues which need to be fixed for the next release.

* The debugger is now using Mini, so we should have a GUI element which lets you specify
  the JIT optimizations.

* The ProgramToDebug dialog needs some loving; for instance, there is no way to specify
  environment variables.

* "Insert breakpoint" from the context menu computes the wrong coordinates and thus
  inserts the breakpoint somewhere, but not where the user actually klicked.
  This is bug #40869.
