This is a list of GUI issues which need to be fixed for the next release.

* The debugger is now using Mini, so we should have a GUI element which lets you specify
  the JIT optimizations.

* The ProgramToDebug dialog needs some loving; for instance, there is no way to specify
  environment variables.
