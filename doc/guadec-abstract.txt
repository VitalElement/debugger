Title: The Mono Debugger

Abstract:

The Mono Debugger is a completely new debugger which is written in C#.  Unlike
other graphical debugger frontends, it is a completely new debugger and now just
a wrapper for an external debugger application such as gdb.  While our main focus
was producing a debugger for .NET applications, it can also debug "normal" Unix
applications.

In this talk, I'll give an overview of the overall architecture of the debugger,
explain why we wrote a completely new debugger and how it interacts with Mono's
JIT engine.  Since the debugger is designed in a very modular way, it's also easy
to write other frontends for it or to integrate it in IDE applications.

I'll also demonstrate the GUI and explain people how to debug their applications
with it, so this talk will be interesting both for users and for potential
developers.

At the end of the talk, I'll also explain which areas of the debugger need more
work and where potential contributors can help with making an even better
super-kick-ass application.

Biography:

Martin is a student of applied mathematics and computer science in Germany.  He
became involved with GNOME and Free Software since the early days of this project.
After taking a longer leave to concentrate on university, he quickly became involved
with the Mono project and finally became employed by this wonderful and great company
Ximian where he's now hacking on Mono and the Mono Debugger as much as his student
live permits.
