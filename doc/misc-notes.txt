- DebuggerBackend.InsertBreakpoint returns an index which is
  different from Breakpoint.Index; we should use the same
  number space here to make things easier for the GUI.

- when making the release, you need to increment the
  following version numbers:

  in mcs/class/Mono.CSharp.Debugger/MonoSymbolTable.cs:
    OffsetTable.Version

  in mono/metadata/debug-mono-symfile.h:
    MONO_SYMBOL_FILE_VERSION (must match OffsetTable.Version)
    MONO_SYMBOL_FILE_DYNAMIC_VERSION

  in debugger/backends/mono-csharp/MonoCSharpLanguageBackend.cs:
    MonoSymbolFileTable.DynamicVersion (must match
    MONO_SYMBOL_FILE_DYNAMIC_VERSION)

- create product in bugzilla

- while the background thread is reloading modules and
  symtabs: should we allow any stepping operations in the UI?

  When the target dlopen()s a module and then calls a method
  in that module, the debugger won't enter it if the
  background thread is still reloading the symtabs.

  See class/SymbolTableManager.cs:
  SymbolTableUpdateInProgress will be true and you can use
  the SymbolTable property to block until the reload is
  done.
