Some notes about debugging unmanaged applications:

- we can't get the type information from System.Reflection,
  so we need to read it from the DWARF 2 debugging info.
  Not yet implemented.

  This'd be a bit difficult to implement for someone who's
  not familiar with the DWARF 2 debugging format, I can
  probably do this on a weekend in december.

- calling unmanaged methods: must have a marshaller, maybe
  we can use PInvoke ?

- also need to read address + size of locals / params from
  DWARF 2.

- already finished: single-stepping, backtraces, breakpoints
  (TODO: breakpoints in not yet loaded shared libraries)

- we already get a notification when shared libs are
  changed, but we aren't doing anything in the event handler
  yet.
