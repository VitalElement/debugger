These are copies of some third party widgets, they are here just to simplify the development
of the Debugger, and we will use the main versions instead of having our own copy when
those widgets become mainstream.

No changes are done unless explicitly listed. 

	GtkSourceView:
		From GNOME CVS Repository, module `gtksourceview'


Please avoid making changes to the code here, and instead get the changes on the
main development version, and we will resync the code here
