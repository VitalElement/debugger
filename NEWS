Added support for properties (read-only).

Added support for breakpoints.  Breakpoints can be set for not-yet-JITed methods and will
persist across multiple invocations of the same target.

Started to work on "dynamic breakpoints".  The JIT now uses a special breakpoint
trampoline if you insert a breakpoint for a not-yet-JITed method.  This trampoline is at a
fixed address in memory and it contains a breakpoint - when this breakpoint is hit, the
debugger reads some data from the stack, inserts all breakpoints for the method and then
continues the target.  This technique will also be used if you insert a breakpoint for a
source location, the target exits and you restart it - the debugger will automatically
transform all your breakpoints into dynamic breakpoints.  There's still some work to be
done, will hack a bit more on this tomorrow.

------------------------------------

Type support for most types (fundamental, enums, strings, arrays, multi-dimensional
arrays, structs, classes) is now done - at least for method parameters.  There are still
some problems with local variables since the JIT doesn't provide this information yet.

It's time to start writing news items :-)

Did a larger restructuring of the interfaces and directory layout.
Everything which is architecture or backend dependent is now hidden in its own library.
