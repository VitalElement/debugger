Released version 0.2.0 "Boston" of the Mono Debugger :-)

January 17th, 2003 - Martin Baulig
----------------------------------

We have a new thread manager in mono/io-layer which is now used when debugging managed
applications.  This thread manager is portable and works on all flavors of Unix.

January 14th, 2003 - Martin Baulig
----------------------------------

The Debugger is now working on FreeBSD 4.7.

It wasn't actually that much work to port it, just cleaning up the APIs a bit and then a
few adjustments - a simple one afternoon job.

You can debug native applications or read core files; managed applications and
multi-threaded apps don't work yet.

January 5th, 2003 - Martin Baulig
---------------------------------

Added a note to RELEASE-NOTES-0.1.0.txt about the release which never really happened.

After an almost complete rewrite of the SingleSteppingEngine to support debugging
multi-threaded applications, the debugger is now getting more and more stable again.

Today, the debugger is entering a feature freeze for the 0.2.0 release.  My main focus is
now fixing all the remaining bugs and stabilizing all the existing features to make the
debugger actually usable.

I was a bit too lazy to write NEWS items the last two weeks.

Today is Tuesday, it's one hour past Midnight and on Saturday I'll be sitting in an air
plane to New York City to enjoy my holidays before university starts again.

The last few days, I did a lot of bug fixing and stabilizing in the backend.  Tonight, I
started concentrate entirely on bug fixing, writing documentation and working towards a
release.  Due to the limited time I have left, I must consider the backend as more or less
feature complete and work towards making a stable and usable release.

October 1st, 2002 - Martin Baulig
---------------------------------

Added support for properties (read-only).

October 1st, 2002 - Martin Baulig
---------------------------------

Added support for breakpoints.  Breakpoints can be set for not-yet-JITed methods and will
persist across multiple invocations of the same target.

September 27th, 2002 - Martin Baulig
------------------------------------

Started to work on "dynamic breakpoints".  The JIT now uses a special breakpoint
trampoline if you insert a breakpoint for a not-yet-JITed method.  This trampoline is at a
fixed address in memory and it contains a breakpoint - when this breakpoint is hit, the
debugger reads some data from the stack, inserts all breakpoints for the method and then
continues the target.  This technique will also be used if you insert a breakpoint for a
source location, the target exits and you restart it - the debugger will automatically
transform all your breakpoints into dynamic breakpoints.  There's still some work to be
done, will hack a bit more on this tomorrow.

September 27th, 2002 - Martin Baulig
------------------------------------

Type support for most types (fundamental, enums, strings, arrays, multi-dimensional
arrays, structs, classes) is now done - at least for method parameters.  There are still
some problems with local variables since the JIT doesn't provide this information yet.

September 21th, 2002 - Martin Baulig
------------------------------------

It's time to start writing news items :-)

Did a larger restructuring of the interfaces and directory layout.
Everything which is architecture or backend dependent is now hidden in its own library.
