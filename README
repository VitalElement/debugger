This is a private work branch based on r102118 to provide support for
ASP.NET and debugging web pages in the debugger.  It was created on
April 29th and will mostly contain potentially unstable symbol writer
changes.

NOTE:
Kahalo is a planet from Perry Rhodan, it is located near the center of
our galaxy and held the control station for the Milky Way - Andromeda
transmitter.

The planet exploded on August 25th, 2405.

The next major debugger release containing full ASP.NET and web page /
web service debugging support will be called "Andromeda".
