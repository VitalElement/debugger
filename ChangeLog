	* backends/server/i386-linux-ptrace.c: Added hardware breakpoints.

	* backends/SingleSteppingEngine.cs: Use a hardware breakpoint for
	the temporary breakpoints; this'll avoid some bigger headaches
	with threads.

2002-12-13  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	WARNING: The Debugger is currently more or less broken since I
	haven't finished all this stuff yet.

	Rewrote and redesigned the SingleSteppingEngine to do all the
	stepping in a background thread.

	* backends/server/*, backends/ptrace/PTrace.cs: Simplified this
	ugly async stuff; since we're now running in our own thread, we
	can just wait for our child.

2002-12-13  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	* frontends/scripting/Parser.cs: Added `finish' command.

	* frontends/command-line/Interpreter.cs: Commented out almost
	everything in this file; it'll go away really soon.

	than Gtk.ThreadNotify, but we can't link against gtk in the
	backend.

	* classes/IOChannel.cs (IODataInputChannel, IODataOutputChannel):
	Added these classes for data channels.

	* backends/Process.cs, backends/Debugger.cs: Moved all
	process-specific stuff to the new `Process' class.

	now returns a new Process.

2002-12-10  Martin Baulig  <martin@ximian.com>

	* frontends/scripting/ScriptingContext.cs: Renamed `Process' to

	one thread per object.

2002-12-08  Radek Doulik  <rodo@ximian.com>

2002-10-12  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	Implemented a SymbolTableManager which maintains all the symbol
	tables and which uses a separate thread to update things in the
	background.

	Since reading the source list is a very CPU consuming operation
	and the source list is only needed when inserting a new breakpoint,
	it is now also read in the background thread.

	* class/SymbolTableManager.cs: This class now maintains all the
	symbol tables.  It's using a separate thread to update things in
	the background.

	* class/Module.cs: Added property to get the ISymbolTable.

	* backends/Debugger.cs: Do all the symbol table handling here

	get the memory maps as an array of TargetMemoryArea's.

2002-10-08  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* backends/mono-csharp/MonoCSharpLanguageBackend.cs
	(MonoCSharpLanguageBackend): Don't derive from SymbolTable but use
	a separate symbol table. This allows us to release the symbol
	table completely when the target exits.

	use the StateChanged event instead.

2002-10-05  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	view of the register, so we can modify the flags at some point,
	and also to encourage the creation of target-specific register
	views that make sense for that particular target. 

	* frontends/gui/Utils.cs: Bug fix.

2002-10-01  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* frontends/gui/DebuggerGUI.cs (DebuggerGUI.LoadProgram): Call
	SetBackend() on the source_view.

2002-09-18  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* class/ObjectCache.cs: New public class.  Keeps a hard reference
	to an object and transforms the hard reference into a weak
	reference after a timeout.

	* class/DwarfReader.cs, SymbolTable.cs, MethodBase.cs, MethodSource.cs:
	Use the new ObjectCache.

	* class/TargetException (TargetException): Made this abstract.

	* class/InternalError.cs: New exception class.

2002-09-18  Martin Baulig  <martin@gnome.org>

	* interfaces/ITargetMemoryAccess.cs (ITargetMemoryReader.BinaryReader):
	Return a TargetBinaryReader instead of a BinaryReader.

	* backends/debugger.cs (TargetReader): Derive from TargetBinaryReader.

	* class/TargetBinaryReader.cs: New public class.  Moved most of
	DwarfReader.DwarfBinaryReader's functionality here.  Implement the
	Mono.CSharp.Debugger.IMonoBinaryReader interface so that we can
	pass an instance of this class to the symbol reader.

	* backends/gdb/*: Removed, nothing useful there anymore.

2002-09-18  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* frontends/gui/DebuggerGUI.cs: Rework the bootstrap phase for the
	program, now it is posisble to specify the program and arguments
	from a dialog box, or to pass them on the command line.

	Now it guesses the kind of program (managed/unmanaged) without
	having to use the `native' prefix.

	Added a few more event hooks to the UI.

	* frontend/gui/Everything that depends on DebuggerWidget: It no
	longer takes a backend argument.  The backend is now configured by
	a SetBackend virtual method.  If you want to hook up to this, you
	have to override the method, and extend it.

	* frontend/gui/debugger.glade: New user interface similar to
	the VisualStudio debugger.

2002-09-17  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* frontends/gui/DebuggerGUI.cs: Use embeded debugger.glade
	resource instead of loading from the configuration data.

	* test/Makefile.in: Embed debugger.glade.
