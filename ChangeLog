	* class/TargetBinaryReader.cs: New public class.  Moved most of
	DwarfReader.DwarfBinaryReader's functionality here.

	* backends/gdb/*: Removed, nothing useful there anymore.

	* frontends/gui/DebuggerGUI.cs: Rework the bootstrap phase for the
	program, now it is posisble to specify the program and arguments
	from a dialog box, or to pass them on the command line.

	Now it guesses the kind of program (managed/unmanaged) without
	having to use the `native' prefix.

	Added a few more event hooks to the UI.

	* frontend/gui/Everything that depends on DebuggerWidget: It no
	longer takes a backend argument.  The backend is now configured by
	a SetBackend virtual method.  If you want to hook up to this, you
	have to override the method, and extend it.

	* frontend/gui/debugger.glade: New user interface similar to
	the VisualStudio debugger.

2002-09-17  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* frontends/gui/DebuggerGUI.cs: Use embeded debugger.glade
	resource instead of loading from the configuration data.

	* test/Makefile.in: Embed debugger.glade.
